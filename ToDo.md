# Brainstorming
- How to keep the user engaged in the app:
            - Online Coupons: for example ralphs -- https://www.ralphs.com/cl/coupons/ -- many more supermarkets also have these offers
            
- Revenue streams:
            - Ads: https://github.com/MichaelStott/KivMob   __ https://www.reddit.com/r/kivy/comments/6ru33d/banner_advertising_android_examples_for_kivy/ __ https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/AdBuddiz-Android-advertisements-integration-for-Kivy-apps  __ https://www.theseusmedia.com/blogs/code/post/1
